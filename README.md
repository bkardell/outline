# Document Outline Project
Discussing "a document outline" is pretty complicated.  First, we need a lot of data we can talk about in terms of markup.  Then we need a way to discuss various proposals in terms of that markup.  That's the idea here then - this is just a a place where we can collect a bunch of stuff that isn't dedicated to any particular solution, but rather at giving us ways to work together toward the solution.

In this project is a [use-cases](use-cases) folder into which we can but a bunch of markup fragments about potential HTML "input".  

In this project is also a [proposals](proposals) folder into which we can organize potential proposals.  Proposals should describe themselves and make a commitment to explain how they handle the markup for each use case.  Ideally, proposals should eventually also include a polyfill of some kind.

The idea is that we can link them up here with a brief explanation and all collaborate on trying them out, filling out the use cases or tweaking the proposals.
