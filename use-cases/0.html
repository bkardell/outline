<h1>Headings and the Seinfeld pitch</h1>
<p>Because of its origins, HTML has a number of elements and concepts which are, in retrospect, probably not so great. ...</p>
<p>Some stuff about paragraphs</p>
<h2>If it walks like a duck</h2> 
<p>Explaining the history of paragraphs are from a visual medium which has particular physical constraints</p>
<h2>Flat earth markup</h2>
<p>Explaining that paragraphs in HTML came from SGML which came from the editors marks, and were flat - like this document.</p>
<h2>Much ado about nothing?</h2>
<p>Is it really such a big deal? Yes, it kind of is, here's why</p>
<h2>Round Earth Headings</h2>
<p>Documents have rich structure now, this old idea is problematic</p>
<h2>The Seinfeld Pitch</h2>
<p>Let's make a simpler solution where insides and outsides match by default</p>
<p>Very special thanks</p>
