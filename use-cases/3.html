    <h3>On headings</h3>
    <p>This is a section expanding your throughts on headings/sectioning and paragraph introducing the next section which is killer...</p>

    	<h2>And now the big reveal</h2>
    	<p>This bit is really important and wants to be visually emphasized so you make it an h2.  
         Because there is a section container, if I wanted to style the subsection, there are ways to do that.
         In other words, I designed the structures to communicate that, perhaps with some margins... 
         Visually, Seems good.
      </p>
    	<p>Except, the document structure is totally disconnected from expressed heading reality. What is "the section" that represents the h3 - does it contain the h2, or is h2 a sibling in your outline?  Unfortunately many uses of sections are frequently effectively just a 'div'.</p>
