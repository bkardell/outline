<article>
  <h3>This is an old legacy article</h3>
  <p>It's stored in a CMS and assumes headings start at h3.</p>
  <h4>But then the template changed!</h4>
  <p>The site wanted to make use of nested sections, but this content should still work.</p>
</article>

  <h1>This is a newer article</h1>
  <p>It's written with a nested outline in mind.</p>
  <section>
    <h1>It contains subsections</h1>
    <p>It should work alongside other articles.</p>
  </section>
