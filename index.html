		<h1>Comparisons tool explained</h1>
		<p>
			Talking about how a document outline should work in theory is
			interesting, but in a lot of cases imagining the impact of proposed
			solutions can be really hard.  The aim of this project is to encourage
			us to collect use cases and, if possible, speculative polyfills of
			the implementations of our theories.  The aim of the comparison tool
			then is to allow a number of people to to more easily examine the impacts of such a solution.
		</p>

		<p>There are a lot of impacts to consider here and, as such, it was
			difficult to think of a way to do this that both makes as much as possible as clear as possible and yet still doesn't exessively "get in the way" because headings are and always kind of have been a little of a wonky outlier in a lot of ways.  For example, any element at all can have a <code>role=heading</code> and an <code>aria-level=<em>N</em></code> which makes it "mean" something very like h1-h6 from a lot of points of view, but has no impact on style, selectors, etc. While you can select anything with an attribute of <code>role=heading</code>, you still can't select anything with a that implicit role.
